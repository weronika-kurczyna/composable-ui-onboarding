# Accessibility

Composable UI is built with accessibility and ensures that the pages and components are designed and developed to be inclusive for users with disabilities. Composable UI leverages the features of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) to provide accessibility features used by modern browsers and web standards, such as ARIA. With Composable UI, a wider range of users can use your e-commerce solution without spending time and effort to ensure accessibility in the long run.

For more information about accessibility at the component-level, see the [Chakra UI's documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/accordion/usage#accessibility).
