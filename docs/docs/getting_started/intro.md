# Composable UI

Composable UI is an open-source project focused on educating people about composable commerce. Composable UI aims to demonstrate the benefits of working with headless services and building a foundation for a modern e-commerce site. With Composable UI, you can design and implement a highly flexible and scalable e-commerce solution with the headless services of your choice.

Composable UI uses React and Next.js as the foundation for building a composable commerce site. Next.js offers fast performance, automatic code splitting, SEO optimization, and easy setup and customization. Additionally, Next.js provides the ability to easily create API routes, which allows you to build custom backend services as needed and integrate with other systems and services from the same codebase.
