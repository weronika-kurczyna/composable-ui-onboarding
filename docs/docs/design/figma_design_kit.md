# Figma Design Kit

The [Figma design kit](http://figma.composable.com) in Composable UI consists of a mirrored React component library and the reference documentation. This kit provides the foundations and tools to build your design system faster.

With the Figma design kit, you can achieve:

* **Consistency**: You can maintain a cohesive look and feel by using the consistent visual and interaction guidelines across all pages and components, and ensure that users have a consistent experience while using the site.

* **Efficiency**: You can create, manage, and reuse design components, such as buttons, typography, and colour palettes, and reduce the time and effort to design new pages.

* **Collaboration**: The cloud-based design system helps designers, developers, and stakeholders to collaborate in real time and get feedback on designs to improve the final result and ensure that everyone is aligned on the design vision for the commerce site.

* **Faster Development**: The clear and comprehensive design specifications in the kit help developers to reduce the time needed for design and development iterations, which helps to get the site to market faster.
