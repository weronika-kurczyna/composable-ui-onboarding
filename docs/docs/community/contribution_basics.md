## Reporting Issues

- To report a bug or request a feature, submit an issue in the [Composable UI GitHub repository](https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui/issues).

Ensure that you add all required details in your description, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant error messages.

## Branch and Commit Strategy

The following branch prefixes are recommended:

- **feat**: Any new feature.

For example:

- `feat/implement_reset_password_flow`
